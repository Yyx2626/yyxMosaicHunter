# yyxMosaicHunter
{yyxMosaicHunter} is an R package implemented MosaicHunter model using numerical algorithm,
which could run for low-throughput ultra-high-depth sites in targeted sequencing, such as PASM.

I also implemented plug-in C codes using {Rcpp} to speed up the dynamic programming algorithm dealing with baseQs.

In the file yyxMosaicHunter_0.1.4.package.zip,
yyxMosaicHunter_0.1.4.tar.gz contains the source code,
while yyxMosaicHunter_0.1.4.zip in two release_* folders are the release for Windows platform.
